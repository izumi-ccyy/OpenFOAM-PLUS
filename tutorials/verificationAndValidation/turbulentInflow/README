Synthetic turbulence inflow tests
======================

The following three synthetic turbulence inflow boundary conditions are
examined through a single-cell-domain smooth-wall plane channel flow setup:

- turbulentDFSEMInlet
- turbulentDigitalFilterInlet variant=digitalFilter
- turbulentDigitalFilterInlet variant=reducedDigitalFilter

The input statistics are obtained from:

    Moser, Kim & Mansour
    "DNS of Turbulent Channel Flow up to Re_tau=590",
    Physics of Fluids (1999) vol 11, 943-945.
    doi.org/10.1063/1.869966

from which the input first-/second-order turbulence statistics data for the 
smooth-wall plane channel flow at Re=395 were used.

The data is available online from (Retrieved: 21-06-2019):

Serial executing:

./Allrun

Parallel (decompositionMethod=scotch) executing:

./Allrunparallel

Both scripts run the test case, and collect the OpenFOAM samples, and plots into
the 'results' directory.
